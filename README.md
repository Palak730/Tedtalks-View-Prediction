# Tedtalks-View-Prediction
This project explores the factors that influence the popularity of TED Talks, using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. Through EDA, we gain insights into the patterns, trends, and correlations in the TED Talk dataset, focusing on features such as views, comments, duration, and publication details. 


Subsequently, we employ various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regression, GradientBoostingRegressor, and XGB Regression, to predict the views of TED Talks and understand the significance of different features in determining their popularity. The project aims to provide valuable insights to TED Talk creators and individuals interested in content engagement and audience preferences in the online world.
